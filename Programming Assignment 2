# 1. Write a Python program to convert kilometers to miles? 
## miles = km/1.60934
  
   # Taking kilometers input from the user
kilometers = float(input("Enter value in kilometers: "))

# calculate miles
miles = kilometers /1.60934
print('%0.2f kilometers is equal to %0.2f miles' %(kilometers,miles))
