# 1. Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.

class Task1:
    def gen(self, n):
        for i in range(n+1):
            if i%7 == 0:
                yield i
nums = Task1()

print([i for i in nums.gen(100)])


# 2. Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.

def task2(string: str):
    
    string_list = string.split(' ')
    out_dict = {}
    
    for s in string_list:

        print(k, ':', v)
        
task2('New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3')


# 3. Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a method "getGender" which can print "Male" for Male class and "Female" for Female class.

class Person:
    def getGender(self):
        pass
    
class Male(Person):
    def getGender(self):
        print('Male')

    def getGender(self):
        print('Female')
        
male = Male()
female= Female()
male.getGender()
female.getGender()

# 4. Please write a program to generate all sentences where subject is in ["I", "You"] and verb is in ['Play', "Love"] and the object is in ["Hockey","Football"].

subject=["I", "You"]
verb=["Play", "Love"]
obj=["Hockey","Football"]

sentence_list = []

for i in subject:
    for j in verb:
        for k in obj:
            sentence_list.append(i + " " + j + " " + k)
            
for sentence in sentence_list:
    print(sentence)

# 5. Please write a program to compress and decompress the string "hello world!hello world!hello world!hello world!"

import zlib

string = 'hello world!hello world!hello world!hello world!'

compress_string = zlib.compress(bytes(string, 'utf-8'))

print(f"Compressed string is: {compress_string}")
print(f"Decompressed string is: {zlib.decompress(compress_string)}")


# 6. Please write a binary search function which searches an item in a sorted list. The function should return the index of element to be searched in the list.

def binarySearch(list1, n):  
    
    
    low = 0  
    high = len(list1) - 1  
    mid = 0  
  
    while low <= high:  
        mid = (high + low) // 2  
        if list1[mid] < n:  
            low = mid + 1  
        elif list1[mid] > n:  
            high = mid - 1  
        else:  
            return mid  
    return -1
    
    
sorted_list = [1, 4, 5, 12, 54, 678, 1235]
